When developing a new feature please create a new feature branch:

git checkout -b {Initials}-{FeatureName}-{Type}

for example to create the branch: PM-InputService-Feature:

git checkout -b PM-InputService-Feature

As you make changes you will want to regulary commit to *your* branch

First, to stage your newly created files (tell git you want it to track them)

git add *or* or git add .

Then to create a commit (think of this like a check point):

git commit -m "{ }"
